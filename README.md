## Hi, I'm Anjan! 👋

cs & applied math @ stony brook

I’m a software developer who likes building useful, real-world systems, especially where AI, ML, and mobile intersect.

In my free time, I enjoy making things and going down rabbit holes in math, ML, and systems. Lately I’ve been into geospatial algorithms, wearable data, and iOS development.

Some things I’m well familiar with:

- Building mobile apps with SwiftUI, MapKit, CoreLocation, and Mapbox
- Machine learning & NLP with Python, HuggingFace, and real-world datasets
- Geospatial & backend systems using Python, ETL pipelines, APIs, and AWS
- General software dev with Java, JavaScript, Git, and full-stack workflows

STAY FOR A BIT LONGER! — check these out 😊
